*Introduction: Market Share Analysis with Pie Chart Representation using R*

In this project, we're diving into the world of banking to understand who's leading the pack.
Using the power of the R programming language, we'll analyze and visualize market share data.
The goal is to create a pie chart that shows, in a simple and clear way, how much each bank contributes to the overall market.
This visual representation will help us identify the major players and grasp the dynamics between private and public banks.
By the end, we'll have a tool that's not only insightful but also adaptable for future market explorations. 
Let's embark on this journey to unravel the market share story!
